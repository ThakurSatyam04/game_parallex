            Video games,[a] also known as computer games, are electronic games that involve interactionwith a 
            user interface or input device such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motionsensing device  
            to generate audiovisual feedback. This feedback is most commonly shown on avideo display device, 
            such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Somecomputer games do not 
            always depend on a graphics display; for example, text adventure gamesand computer chess can be 
            played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmentedwith audio feedback delivered 
            through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types offeedback, including haptic 
            technology.

            The act of playing games, as in:

            Legalized gambling, playing games of chance for money, often referred to in law as "gaming"
            Playing a role-playing game, in which players assume fictional roles
            Playing a tabletop game, any game played on a flat surface

            PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game 
            developed by PUBG Studios and published by Krafton. The game, which was inspired by the 
            Japanese film Battle Royale (2000), is based on previous mods created by Brendan 
            "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's 
            creative direction. It is the first game in the PUBG Universe series.

            The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective. In the game, up to
            one hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to
            kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the
            game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever tightening
            space to force encounters. The last surviving player (or team) wins the round.
                
            It was first released for Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a
            full release in December 2017. The game was also released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One
            via its Xbox Game Preview program that same month, and officially released in September 2018.
            PUBG Mobile, a free-to-play mobile game version for Android and iOS, was released in 2018, in
            addition to a port for the PlayStation 4. A version for the Stadia streaming platform was
            released in April 2020, with Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions being released in
            November 2020. The game has been free-to-play for all platforms since January 12, 2022.

            Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North
            and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, 
            following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the 
            fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows 
            three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and 
            drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their attempts to commit heists while under 
            pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets 
            players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based 
            on Los Angeles.

            The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world
            is navigated on foot and by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists 
            throughoutsingle-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is 
            centred onthe heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A "wanted" 
            systemgoverns the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. Grand 
            TheftAuto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety 
            ofdifferent cooperative and competitive game modes.

            Clash of Clans is a 2012 free-to-play mobile strategy video game developed and published by
            Finnish game developer Supercell. The game was released for iOS platforms on August 2, 2012,
            and on Google Play for Android on October 7, 2013.

            The game is set in a fantasy-themed[3] persistent world[4] where the player is a chief of a
            village. Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained
            from attacking other player's villages with troops; earning rewards, buying them with medals or
            by producing them at their own village. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir.
            Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people, who can then participate in
            Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other. The minimum number of
            players of a Clan War is thirty. [5]
                
            Clash of Clans was released to generally positive reviews from critics.                
            
            Four spin-off games in the same universe of Clash of Clans were developed by Supercell. The
            first, Clash Royale, was released in 2016.[6] The other three, Clash Quest, Clash Minis, and
            Clash Heroes, were announced in April 2021.[7][8] Clash Quest development was discontinued on
            17 August 2022.[9]
